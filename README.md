# Jai Hari Nataraj — Personal Portfolio

Hi, I am Jai Hari Nataraj, a passionate **Front-End Developer** skilled in building responsive and modern web applications. I specialize in **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and creating smooth user experiences with attention to UI/UX design details.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, showcasing the projects I have built, the technologies I use, and my commitment to clean, scalable, and interactive design. It highlights my work in both individual and collaborative projects, with a focus on performance, accessibility, and design aesthetics.

## Portfolio Overview

This web portfolio includes:

-  A clean and modern design inspired by developer-centric themes  
-  A projects section with detailed case studies and demos  
-  A short introduction, skills stack, and tools I use  
-  A contact section with my social links  
-  Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop

I built this portfolio using **React.js** and **SCSS**, with a focus on **performance, accessibility**, and **developer-friendly code structure**.

## Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to present myself professionally to recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators — giving them a quick look into who I am, what I build, and how I approach front-end development.
